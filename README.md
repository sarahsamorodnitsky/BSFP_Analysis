# BSFP

The files in this repository perform the following measures:

* bsfp.R contains all functions needed for BPMF
* bpmf_validation.R contains the validation study for the BPMF model. Results 
  from validation simulations can be found in the validation_results folder. 
* hiv_copd_application_V2.R contains the Data Application, where the BPMF
  model is fit on proteomic and metabolomic data to predict percent predicted
  forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1pp). Data for this application can 
  be found in the data folder. 
* bpmf_simulation.R contains the simulation study to compare various models on 
  how they recovery latent variation structure and predict an outcome.
